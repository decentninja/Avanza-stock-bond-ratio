# Development Notes
The application consists of two parts.
* A rust executable, that handles the analysis and the user-facing-command-line interface.
* A Nodejs script, that that calls Github user Fhqvst's Avanza module.

The Rust executable runs the Nodejs script as a child process.
The two parts talk with each other over a stdin/out/err readline interface.
